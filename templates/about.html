    <p>
        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
		recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain when
		Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
		Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
		Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
		action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
		leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
			<p>
				In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely Mountain.
				Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA
				2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in the
				Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some
				point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained
				the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.

			<p>
				Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews of
				Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose,
				the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

            <p>
                Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Oin's uncle was King Fundin, the
                father of Balin and Dwalin. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought in the Battle of
                Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and Company on the quest to reclaim the
                Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood

            <h3>Gloin</h3>
            <p>
                Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the Dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin and younger
                brother of Óin.
                In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the Dwarves
                and Orcs, though it is unknown what significance he did, being 16 years old.
                In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In March of TA
                2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin to reclaim Erebor, so
                that Smaug wouldn't start an alliance with Sauron. When Gandalf mentioned hobbits, Glóin referred them as
                "simpletons" and also said that hobbits "would never dare to come within smelling distance of the nakedest dragonet
                new from the shell".

            <h3>Balin</h3>
            <p>
                Balin was a Dwarf leader, the son of Fundin, and elder brother of Dwalin. He was one of the thirteen Dwarves who
                accompanied Thorin II Oakenshield on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain.
                A Dwarf Lord known for his wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of Thorin's closest friends and
                advisers. Balin was distantly related to him, and a descendant of the noble house of Durin.
                He later went to re-establish the kingdom of Moria, but within five years it was overcome once more by Orcs, and he
                was killed there along with the rest of his companions

            <h3>Dwalin</h3>
            <p>
                Born in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had desolated Erebor, Dwalin was the son of Fundin and younger
                brother of Balin. After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin accompanied Thrain the Second
                and Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.
                Later in TA 2841, Dwalin, along with his brother Balin, and a few others accompanied Thráin when he left the Ered
                Luin to visit Erebor. The small party was dogged by the emissaries of Sauron. In TA 2845, Thráin was captured one
                night when he and his companions sheltered under the eaves of Mirkwood from a black rain. After a fruitless search
                for their leader, the Dwarves gave up and returned to Thorin to inform him the news.

            <h3>Dori</h3>
            <p>
                Dori was a Dwarf of Durin's Folk, who, along with his brother Nori and cousin Ori,[1] travelled with Bilbo Baggins
                and Thorin Oakenshield as a member of Thorin's Company on the Quest for Erebor, to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from
                the dragon Smaug.
            
                Dori was among the Dwarves at Bag End who joined in singing about "blunting the knives" and "bending the forks"; as
                well as accompanying by playing the flute. He was described as “decent fellow despite his grumbling”. He often wore
                a red-violet coat while on the Quest for Erebor. He was noted by Thorin to be the strongest of the thirteen
                companions

                Nori, as was his brother Dori, was a capable flutist, and both seem to have carried their flutes with them. Both
                shared Bilbo's liking for regular meals. Before the Quest for the Lonely Mountain, Nori lived in Thorin's Halls in
                the northern Blue Mountains with his two brothers.

                Whilst he was a descendant of the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, Bifur was not of Durin's Folk. Most of his familial
                relations are unclear, and what is known of his parentage is very little. He and his family were driven out of their
                home in the Lonely Mountain by the Dragon Smaug, and were forced to live in exile, where the Dwarf warrior worked as
                a toy maker. Following Thorin II Oakenshield to a new life in the Blue Mountains, he continued his life as a toy
                maker.

                Bofur's heritage is unclear, but he was not of Durin's Folk. He and his family hailed from the Blue Mountains. As
                such, they felt less strongly about the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug, more interested
                in the adventure than a home they'd never seen.

                Bombur's parentage is unknown. He is the brother of Bofur and cousin of Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's line,
                although he was descended from the Dwarves of Moria. His birth date is unknown, though it fell somewhere between TA
                2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of the thirteen "by some fifty years," and, after
                Thorin was captured, Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli was born in TA 2859, and Balin was born in TA 2763. Bombur
                was thus roughly 150 years old during the quest. Prior to the journey, Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains
                alongside Thorin, after the loss of Thráin II.

            <h3>Gandalf</h3>
            <p>
                Originally called Olórin, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar (with the possible exception of Melian). He
                was created by Ilúvatar before the Music of the Ainur[1], and was at the beginning of Time amongst the Ainur who
                entered into Eä. In his "youth", he became one of the Maiar who served Manwë, Varda, Irmo and Nienna named. He
                was associated with light and fire, much like his peer Varda. Yet his ways often took him to Nienna, from whom he
                learned pity and patience. He loved the Elves, but he walked unseen among them, or wore a fana that appeared like an
                Elf, and sent them fair visions in their hearts that made them wiser. Throughout his existence, he followed the
                example of Nienna, he took pity on the sorrows of the Children of Ilúvatar and drove those who listened to him out
                of despair.
