        "name": "Thorin Oakenshield",
        "description": "In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thr√°in II in the mountain city of The Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained the epithet 'Oakenshield,' which would remain with him even in death.",
